# WhISTL: Whole blood Infection Signature detection via Transfer Learning

This repository aims to test the efficacy of transfer learning on gene expression data by answering the following questions:

1. Does (pre?)training a classifier to differentiate between blood gene expression from sepsis patients and healthy patients allow us to make better predictions about infectious diseases?
2. Does a sepsis classifier trained on humans have any predictive power on mice?
3. Do gene expression signatures learned by a model trained on microarray data transfer to RNA-seq data?
